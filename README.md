To fix any issues with my **PHP social media network** project, please follow these steps:

1.Download the project files.
2. Create a folder named **university**.
3. Move all the downloaded project files into the **university** folder.
4. Rename the "social-media-platform-php" folder to "full_project".

By following these instructions, you will be able to resolve any problems and ensure that the project is correctly placed within the "university" folder, with the desired name **full_project**.
